				<h3 id="post2">Over the Course of a Journey...</h3>
				</a>
				<blockquote>
					<p><em>"Our greatest fears lie in anticipation."</em>
					</p>
					<footer><cite title="Source Title">Honoré de Balzac</cite>

				<br>
				<p>A short but sweet synopsis of the veritable challenges facing anyone pursuing an unfamiliar venture. Personally, I realize that I maintain a fixed mindset in many respects which serves as the catalyst for me to break out of my comfort zone. Fear is a powerful state of mind but is a condition of self-made capacities. Fear is an illusion whose strength is fueled by the individual and thus meets cessation once one acknowledges that reality is whatever one wills into fruition. To acknowledge the need to change one’s circumstances is quite intimidating.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The Iron Yard is, for me, not just a means to an end regarding future employment. The rigorous curriculum has pushed me into a very new and uncomfortable reality. I have been able to notice the patterns of my own fixed mindset. The anxiety and stress brought on by the program can only be spun into a positive experience of self-empowerment. This journey into coding is one of logical and pragmatic understanding that nothing in life is received without the execution of considerable effort.</p>

				<br>
				<p>
					For many years, I thought that I would fall into a career by chance but this is a fallacy I believed throughout my bachelor’s degree. The years following graduation are a tumultuous rollercoaster of self-discovery. In order to honor my parents and their sacrifices, I must face head-on the uncomfortable feeling that I experience by jumping into a completely different field of study.</p>

				<br>
				<p>
					This is an exciting venture but in all honesty, I felt a great deal of fear prior to the fifth of January. Not only do I lack prior knowledge of programming languages, but I suffer from a fixed mentality that if I meet resistance in any subject, I lose momentum. A great difficulty, but one that bears significant benefit, is understanding that perseverance and tenacity are tools for overcoming any issue. Balzac teaches us that the fear in anticipation is a positive sign toward growth as the uncomfortable nature of breaking the proverbial mold of routine and venture into the unknown, albeit, choosing the road less traveled.</p>

				<h3>the I-Ching</h3>
				<h5>10. Lü/ Treading (Conduct)</h5>
				<!--            <h5>A hexagram whose bottom trigram is “Lake” with a top trigram of “Heaven”</h5>-->
				<blockquote>
					<p><em>"Lasting progress is won through quiet self-discipline."</em>
					</p>
					<footer><cite title="Source Title">Anonymousc</cite>
					</footer>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				<p>
					This hexagram outlines the foundation of proper conduct within ourselves, with those with whom we have conflicts, and within the larger society. It serves to remind us that no genuine gains gain be made unless we are rooted firmly in the principles of the “Sage.”
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					An image often associated with this hexagram is that of treading on the tail of a tiger. The “tiger” may be some strong or malevolent force in your own personality, or it may be a particularly volatile individual or situation with which you have to deal. In either case, the advice of the I Ching is the same: one avoids the bite of the tiger by treading carefully. To tread carefully means that we remain absolutely innocent and conscientious in our thoughts and actions.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					It is inevitable that people will display varying levels of spiritual understanding. It is not our duty to condemn or correct others, but simply to go on developing ourselves. Do not imagine that you can hasten your progress through aggressive actions now. Power that is sought and wielded pridefully has a way of evaporating when you need it most, thus exacerbating your difficulties. The only lasting influence is that which arises naturally from a course of steady self-development.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					In the end, it our inner worth that determines the outer conditions of our lives.Those who resolve to persevere in humility, sincerity, and gentleness can tread anywhere-even on the tail of a tiger-and meet with success.
				</p>
