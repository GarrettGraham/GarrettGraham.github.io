			<h3>Integration is Hot</h3>
			<p>Collaboration is key to a growing business seeking a competitive edge in a challenging marketplace. Social and search marketing are inexorably bound to one another and are valuable for successful market integration. The utmost goal of a business is the bottom line which requires a holistic approach when implementing successful marketing campaigns. Within larger organizations, it can be common that a multi-departmental structure hinders growth with missed opportunities because of misalignment of priorities and departmental goals. One must understand how to implement tactics that are proven to help in-house marketing departments, agencies and consultancies interact to achieve deeper, connected social and search marketing programs.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The presence of artificial barriers separating social and search programs coupled with divisions of strategy, budget, leadership and labor no longer serve modern marketing outcomes. Rethinking and updating how search and social marketing teams interact can revamp a system that otherwise hinders itself. It is especially important to embrace change and reconfiguration should be top priority in a tech environment that moves as quickly as digital marketing. Adaptation and flexibility provides an avenue toward survival in an ever evolving industry. A multi-team organization must embrace change together!</p>

			<h3>Grab Consumer Attention and Keep It</h3>
			<p>In this fast paced and ever changing world, it is imperative to garner the best possible recognition for your business. The online market is a vast ecosystem of consumers who are, according to entrepeneur.com, exposed to more than 5,000 advertisements per day. Of those advertisements, only about 12 will make a lasting impression on the average consumer which invariably limits consumer conversion. It is apparent that there must exist an implementation of strategies that allow your business to augment its identity against the competitive clutter. In order to best retain consumer attention is to first and foremost understand your desired audience and then build emotional connections with those you wish to attract.</p>
			<br>
			<p>No longer is it enough to sell a great product. Your business may have an amazing product that would otherwise sell itself, but the user experience must translate well or a sale can be lost. A psycho-emotionally stimulating and user friendly interface is imperative to a successful conversion funnel. Your business must leverage its online presence to not only present a product but to provide an experience that will augment that product, thereby increasing the odds a website visit will lead to consumer retention. Live by the methodology of “benefits first, features second.” Grab the user’s attention as quick as possible and then explain to them what your product or service does <em>for</em> them. Understanding how your product satisfies the intrinsic need of the consumer will better set your business apart from the competition.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Psychology plays an important role when it comes to understanding your business’ target market. As simplistic as it seems, people avoid painful and unhappy experiences and leveraging this psychology of pain vs. pleasure can be a marketing gold mine when establishing and improving your relationship with your audience. One of the first pleasure psychologists, Epicurus, created the theory of happiness which states that people make choices based on what will ultimately make them happy. Industries such as health and wellness use techniques that demonstrate their value to people by directly addressing obesity in their copy as well as the attainable benefits of their product or service that improves the consumer’s overall well-being. As long as your tactics are ethically bound and do not provide false promises, you can hit a consumer where it hurts as long as you can truly provide a solution.</p>

			<h3>The Essense of Music</h3>
			<blockquote>
			<p><em>"The art of music is divine and effective. It is the food of the soul and spirit"</em></p>
			<footer><cite title="Source Title">Abdu’l-Bahá</cite></footer>
			</blockquote>
			<br>
			<p>To acknowledge the power of music as a means of emotional and spiritual transcendence is nothing short of an understatement. Aside from historical evidence of the profound impetus of auditory stimulation, it is quite apparent that an inherent desire for creating music is woven into the fabric of what can be understood as the universally collective human experience.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Our power as creators is exemplified in what is possible to express through a rhythmic composition of melodic harmony (or lack thereof). Not only does the study of music theory instruct proper chordal progression but, more simplistically, it provides a foundation for comprehending a less than superficial understanding of consonance and dissonance. Inherently understanding what sounds pleasing (and abhorrent) is a ubiquitous attribute of an individual who looks beyond the black and white of printed music. The art of sound is available to all those willing to traverse the journey in becoming what it is to be a spiritually connected being.</p>

		<h3 id="post2">Over the Course of a Journey</h3>

				<blockquote>
					<p><em>"Our greatest fears lie in anticipation."</em></p>
					<footer><cite title="Source Title">Honoré de Balzac</cite>
					</footer>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				<p>...A short but sweet synopsis of the veritable challenges facing anyone pursuing an unfamiliar venture. Personally, I realize that I maintain a fixed mindset in many respects which serves as the catalyst for me to break out of my comfort zone. Fear is a powerful state of mind but is a condition of self-made capacities. Fear is an illusion whose strength is fueled by the individual and thus meets cessation once one acknowledges that reality is whatever one wills into fruition. To acknowledge the need to change one’s circumstances is quite intimidating.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The Iron Yard is, for me, not just a means to an end regarding future employment. The rigorous curriculum has pushed me into a very new and uncomfortable reality. I have been able to notice the patterns of my own fixed mindset. The anxiety and stress brought on by the program can only be spun into a positive experience of self-empowerment. This journey into coding is one of logical and pragmatic understanding that nothing in life is received without the execution of considerable effort.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					For many years, I thought that I would fall into a career by chance but this is a fallacy I believed throughout my bachelor’s degree. The years following graduation are a tumultuous rollercoaster of self-discovery. In order to honor my parents and their sacrifices, I must face head-on the uncomfortable feeling experienced by jumping into a completely different field of study.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					This is an exciting venture but in all honesty, I felt a great deal of fear prior to the fifth of January. Not only do I lack prior knowledge of programming languages, but I suffer from a fixed mentality. If I meet resistance in any subject, I lose momentum. A great difficulty, but one that bears significant benefit, is understanding that perseverance and tenacity are tools for overcoming any issue. Balzac teaches us that the fear in anticipation is a positive sign toward growth, the uncomfortable nature of breaking the proverbial mold of routine and venturing into the unknown, albeit, choosing the road less traveled.</p>

				<h3>The I-Ching</h3>
				<h5>10. Lü/ Treading (Conduct)</h5>
				<img src="img/i-ching-10-lu.jpg" alt="iChing Symbol" class="iChingHexagram">
				<blockquote>
					<p><em>"Lasting progress is won through quiet self-discipline."</em>
					</p>
					<footer><cite title="Source Title">Anonymous</cite>
					</footer>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				<p>
					This hexagram outlines the foundation of proper conduct within ourselves, with those with whom we have conflicts, and within the larger society. It serves to remind us that no genuine gains can be made unless we are rooted firmly in the principles of the “Sage.”
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					An image often associated with this hexagram is that of treading on the tail of a tiger. The “tiger” may be some strong or malevolent force in your own personality, or it may be a particularly volatile individual or situation with which you have to deal. In either case, the advice of the I Ching is the same: one avoids the bite of the tiger by treading carefully. To tread carefully means that we remain absolutely innocent and conscientious in our thoughts and actions.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					It is inevitable that people will display varying levels of spiritual understanding. It is not our duty to condemn or correct others, but simply to go on developing ourselves. Do not imagine that you can hasten your progress through aggressive actions now. Power that is sought and wielded pridefully has a way of evaporating when you need it most, thus exacerbating your difficulties. The only lasting influence is that which arises naturally from a course of steady self-development.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					In the end, it is our inner worth that determines the outer conditions of our lives.Those who resolve to persevere in humility, sincerity, and gentleness can tread anywhere-even on the tail of a tiger-and meet with success.
				</p>
